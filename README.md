# AngularJS
An angularjs customer orders application covering all major concepts

This is a two page angularjs application with customers and orders page.
Customer table can be sorted with columns and also can be filtered with name search.
Same goes for orders table.

I have tried to cover all angularjs major concepts.

-Views, Directives and Filters.
-Controller, Scope and Modules.
-Routing, Factories and Services. And lastly
-UI and Animation.
